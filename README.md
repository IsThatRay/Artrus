# Artrus
A Python program which encourages you to not draw.

Upon running this program, you might wonder: "Psh! A program can't stop me from drawing."
Well, if you're using something other than clip studio paint, that would be true.
HOWEVER! If you're using Clip Studio Paint, you will be met with the seven horsemen of windows notifications,
encouraging you to stop drawing. So watch your back, or else it will strike.
